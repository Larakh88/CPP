# CPP Piscine
Welcome to the CPP Piscine Projects repository! This collection houses a series of projects completed as part of the CPP Piscine curriculum at 42 School. 
One of the fundamental aspects of programming covered in this Piscine is object-oriented programming (OOP) using the C++ language. 
Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior.
These projects are designed to immerse students in the world of C++ programming, here's a brief overview of key OOP concepts covered in the CPP Piscine:


## Classes and Objects
In C++, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. 
They define the structure and behavior of objects by encapsulating data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) within a single unit. 
Through classes, we learn how to model real-world entities and abstract data types, fostering modular and reusable code.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a principle of OOP that promotes bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to the internal state of objects. 
This helps maintain the integrity of data and prevents external code from directly modifying object properties. 
In C++, encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers (public, private, and protected) to control the visibility of class members.

## Inheritance
Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing ones (base classes), allowing for code reuse and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes. 
Derived classes inherit properties and behavior from their base classes, and can further extend or override functionality as needed. 
C++ supports single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance, providing flexibility in designing class hierarchies.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism, which means "many forms," allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface. 
In C++, polymorphism is achieved through function overloading and virtual functions. 
Function overloading enables the creation of multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists, while virtual functions enable dynamic method binding and late binding, facilitating runtime polymorphism.

## Abstraction
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details. 
In C++, abstraction is realized through classes and interfaces, which define a clear separation between the external interface of objects and their internal implementation. 
This enables us to build robust and maintainable software systems by emphasizing high-level concepts and reducing complexity.

## CPP Projects & Containers
CPP Projects and Container Usage
Throughout the CPP Piscine Projects, we also gained experience in using various C++ containers provided by the Standard Library. 
These containers include vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, and more. 
By incorporating these containers into our projects, we learned how to effectively manage data, optimize algorithms, and solve problems using the rich functionality offered by the C++ Standard Library.
By mastering object-oriented concepts in C++, we develop a strong foundation in software design and architecture, preparing us for more advanced programming challenges and real-world applications.
